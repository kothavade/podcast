# simple podcast rss player

- input an rss feed and you can view and play episodes 
- made because i wanted a simple way to play a podcast without:
  - signing up for another website
  - downloading and running an app
- needs a server of cors, so used nextjs instead
- todos:
  - cache last played time for an episodes
  - cache list of rss feeds added
